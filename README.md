# kNN_FX_Price_Action

This project comprises of my attempt to trade Forex based on the predictions made by supervised k- Nearest Neighbour algorithms, with input data being the technical indicators (i.e. moving averages, RSI and Bollinger Band). The dimension of these indicators was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before feeding into the kNN model.
